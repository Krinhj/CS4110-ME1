Reaction Paper on Alan Turing's Computing Machinery and Intelligence‚Äù (1950)

Alan Turing, also known as the Father of Modern Computer Science, is one of the most significant contributors to the field of AI. One of his greatest contributions was the Imitation Game, which was furthered with the introduction of the Turing Test. In 1950, Turing wrote "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", during a time in which artificial intelligence was in its infancy, in the paper, Turing's central argument was that "If a machine can communicate in a way indistinguishable from a human, it should be considered capable of thought". To test this theory, Turing introduced the "Imitation Game", the game was staged as a three-person setup, with a human interrogator conversing with two actors, a human, and a machine, each would try to convince the interrogator that they are human, if the judge was unable to distinguish who the human was from the two actors, the computer would win. 

After reading the paper, there is no argument that Turing's work, particularly his concept of the Imitation Game and the Turing Test, is indeed thought-provoking, forcing us to confront the possibility of machines becoming indistinguishable from humans in their communication abilities. While the text do not explicitly detail machines reaching this level of indistinguishability, Turing's proposition that a machine capable of mimicking human conversation could be considered "thinking" challenges our understanding of intelligence and its potential manifestations. 

To conclude, while the Turing Test was groundbreaking for its time, it lacks the capability to test what makes human thought "human", this is because human thought is so much more complex than just copying the way humans converse, for a machine to truly think, I think that it should possess the other parts of human intelligence, these are: creativity, emotional depth, and a truly genuine understanding of the world, if a machine is only capable of these based on the data that it is fed, then it isn't truly capable of "thinking" as humans do.
